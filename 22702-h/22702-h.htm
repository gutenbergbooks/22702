    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The air was tremulous with farewells. The regiment, recruited within sight
      of the steeples of Waterville, and for three months in camp just outside
      the city, was to march the next morning. A series of great battles had
      weakened the Federal armies, and the authorities at Washington had ordered
      all available men to the front.
    </p>
    <p>
      The camp was to be broken up at an early hour, after which the regiment
      would march through the city to the depot to take the cars. The streets
      along the route of the march were already being decorated with flags and
      garlands. The city that afternoon was full of soldiers enjoying their last
      leave of absence. The liquor shops were crowded with parties of them
      drinking with their friends, while others in threes and fours, with locked
      arms, paraded the streets singing patriotic songs, sometimes in rather
      maudlin voices, for to-day in every saloon a soldier might enter, citizens
      vied for the privilege of treating him to the best in the house. No man in
      a blue coat was suffered to pay for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the most part, however, the men were sober enough over their
      leave-taking. One saw everywhere soldiers and civilians, strolling in
      pairs, absorbed in earnest talk. They are brothers, maybe, who have come
      away from the house to be alone with each other, while they talk of family
      affairs and exchange last charges and promises as to what is to be done if
      anything happens. Or perhaps they are business partners, and the one who
      has put the country's business before his own is giving his last counsels
      as to how the store or the shop shall be managed in his absence. Many of
      the blue-clad men have women with them, and these are the couples that the
      people oftenest turn to look at. The girl who has a soldier lover is the
      envy of her companions to-day as she walks by his side. Her proud eyes
      challenge all who come, saying, &ldquo;See, this is my hero. I am the one he
      loves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You could easily tell when it was a wife and not a sweetheart whom the
      soldier had with him. There was no challenge in the eyes of the wife.
      Young romance shed none of its glamour on the sacrifice she was making for
      her native land. It was only because they could not bear to sit any longer
      looking at each other in the house that she and her husband had come out
      to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the residence parts of the town family groups were gathered on shady
      piazzas, a blue-coated figure the centre of each. They were trying to talk
      cheerfully, making an effort even to laugh a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then one of the women stole unobserved from the circle, but her
      bravely smiling face as she presently returned gave no inkling of the
      flood of tears that had eased her heart in some place apart. The young
      soldier himself was looking a little pale and nervous with all his
      affected good spirits, and it was safe to guess that he was even then
      thinking how often this scene would come before him afterwards, by the
      camp-fire and on the eve of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the village of Upton, some four or five miles out of Waterville, on a
      broad piazza at the side of a house on the main street, a group of four
      persons were seated around a tea-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The centre of interest of this group, as of so many others that day, was a
      soldier. He looked not over twenty-five, with dark blue eyes, dark hair
      cut close to his head, and a mustache trimmed crisply in military fashion.
      His uniform set off to advantage an athletic figure of youthful
      slender-ness, and his bronzed complexion told of long days of practice on
      the drill-ground in the school of the company and the battalion. He wore
      the shoulder-straps of a second lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one side of the soldier sat the Rev. Mr. Morton, his cousin, and on the
      other Miss Bertha Morton, a kindly faced, middle-aged lady, who was her
      brother's housekeeper and the hostess of this occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourth member of the party was a girl of nineteen or twenty. She was a
      very pretty girl, and although to-day her pallid cheeks and red and
      swollen eyelids would to other eyes have detracted somewhat from her
      charms, it was certain that they did not make her seem less adorable to
      the young officer, for he was her lover, and was to march with the
      regiment in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Philip King was a lawyer, and by perseverance and native
      ability had worked up a fair practice for so young a man in and around
      Upton. When he volunteered, he had to make up his mind to leave this
      carefully gathered clientage to scatter, or to be filched from him by less
      patriotic rivals; but it may be well believed that this seemed to him a
      little thing compared with leaving Grace Roberts, with the chance of never
      returning to make her his wife. If, indeed, it had been for him to say, he
      would have placed his happiness beyond hazard by marrying her before the
      regiment marched; nor would she have been averse, but her mother, an
      invalid widow, took a sensible rather than a sentimental view of the case.
      If he were killed, she said, a wife would do him no good; and if he came
      home again, Grace would be waiting for him, and that ought to satisfy a
      reasonable man. It had to satisfy an unreasonable one. The Robertses had
      always lived just beyond the garden from the parsonage, and Grace, who
      from a little girl had been a great pet of the childless minister and his
      sister, was almost as much at home there as in her mother's house. When
      Philip fell in love with her, the Mortons were delighted. They could have
      wished nothing better for either. From the first Miss Morton had done all
      she could to make matters smooth for the lovers, and the present little
      farewell banquet was but the last of many meetings she had prepared for
      them at the parsonage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had come out from camp on a three-hours' leave that afternoon, and
      would have to report again at half-past seven. It was nearly that hour
      now, though still light, the season being midsummer. There had been an
      effort on the part of all to keep up a cheerful tone; but as the time of
      the inevitable separation drew near, the conversation had been more and
      more left to the minister and his sister, who, with observations sometimes
      a little forced, continued to fend off silence and the demoralization it
      would be likely to bring to their young friends. Grace had been the first
      to drop out of the talking, and Philip's answers, when he was addressed,
      grew more and more at random, as the meetings of his eyes with his
      sweetheart's became more frequent and lasted longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be the handsomest officer in the regiment, that's one comfort.
      Won't he, Grace?&rdquo; said Miss Morton cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl nodded and smiled faintly. Her eyes were brimming, and the
      twitching of her lips from time to time betrayed how great was the effort
      with which she kept her self-command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton; &ldquo;but though he looks very well now, it is nothing
      to the imposing appearance he will present when he comes back with a
      colonel's shoulder-straps. You should be thinking of that, Grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect we shall hear from him every day,&rdquo; said Miss Morton. &ldquo;He will
      have no excuse for not writing with all those envelopes stamped and
      addressed, with blank paper in them, which Grace has given him. You should
      always have three or four in your coat pocket, Phil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose for the most part we shall learn of you through Grace; but you
      mustn't forget us entirely, my boy,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton. &ldquo;We shall want to
      hear from you directly now and then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I 'll be sure to write,&rdquo; Philip replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it will be time enough to see the regiment pass if we are in
      our places by nine o'clock,&rdquo; suggested Miss Morton, after a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said her brother. &ldquo;It is a great affair to break camp, and I
      don't believe the march will begin till after that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James has got us one of the windows of Ray &amp; Seymour's offices, you
      know, Philip,&rdquo; resumed Miss Morton; &ldquo;which one did you say, James?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The north one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the north one,&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;They say every window on Main Street
      along the route of the regiment is rented. Grace will be with us, you
      know. You must n't forget to look up at us as you go by&mdash;as if the
      young man were likely to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was evidently not now listening to her at all. His eyes were fastened
      upon the girl's opposite him, and they seemed to have quite forgotten the
      others. Miss Morton and her brother exchanged compassionate glances. Tears
      were in the lady's eyes. A clock in the sitting-room began to strike:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time is that?&rdquo; he asked, a little huskily. No one replied at once.
      Then Mr. Morton said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it struck seven, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must leave in ten minutes then,&rdquo; said the young man, rising from the
      table. The rest followed his example.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if the buggy will be in time?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is at the gate,&rdquo; replied Miss Morton. &ldquo;I heard it drive up some time
      ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unmindful of the others now, Philip put his arm about Grace's waist and
      drew her away to the end of the piazza and thence out into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor young things,&rdquo; murmured Miss Morton, the tears running down her
      cheeks as she looked after them. &ldquo;It is pitiful, James, to see how they
      suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the minister; &ldquo;and there are a great many just such scenes
      to-day. Ah, well, as St. Paul says, we see as yet but in part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Passing in and out among the shrubbery, and presently disappearing from
      the sympathetic eyes upon the piazza, the lovers came to a little
      summer-house, and there they entered. Taking her wrists in his hands, he
      held her away from him, and his eyes went slowly over her from head to
      foot, as if he would impress upon his mind an image that absence should
      not have power to dim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so beautiful,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that in this moment, when I ought to
      have all my courage, you make me feel that I am a madman to leave you for
      the sake of any cause on earth. The future to most men is but a chance of
      happiness, and when they risk it they only risk a chance. In staking their
      lives, they only stake a lottery ticket, which would probably draw a
      blank. But my ticket has drawn a capital prize. I risk not the chance, but
      the certainty, of happiness. I believe I am a fool, and if I am killed,
      that will be the first thing they will say to me on the other side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk of that, Phil. Oh, don't talk of being killed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; of course not!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Don't fret about that; I shall not
      be killed. I've no notion of being killed. But what a fool I am to waste
      these last moments staring at you when I might be kissing you, my love, my
      love!&rdquo; And clasping her in his arms, he covered her face with kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to sob convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't, darling; don't! Don't make it so hard for me,&rdquo; he whispered
      hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do let me cry,&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;It was so hard for me to hold back all
      the time we were at table. I must cry, or my heart will break. Oh, my own
      dear Phil, what if I should never see you again! Oh! Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, darling,&rdquo; he said, crowding down the lump that seemed like iron
      in his throat, and making a desperate effort to keep his voice steady.
      &ldquo;You will see me again, never doubt it. Don't I tell you I am coming back?
      The South cannot hold out much longer. Everybody says so. I shall be home
      in a year, and then you will be my wife, to be God's Grace to me all the
      rest of my life. Our happiness will be on interest till then; ten per
      cent, a month at least, compound interest, piling up every day. Just think
      of that, dear; don't let yourself think of anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Phil, how I love you!&rdquo; she cried, throwing her arms around his neck
      in a passion of tenderness. &ldquo;Nobody is like you. Nobody ever was. Surely
      God will not part us. Surely He will not. He is too good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear, He will not. Some day I shall come back. It will not be long.
      Perhaps I shall find you waiting for me in this same little summer-house.
      Let us think of that. It was here, you know, we found out each other's
      secret that day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had found out yours long before,&rdquo; she said, faintly smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time 's up, Phil.&rdquo; It was Mr. Morton's voice calling to them from the
      piazza.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go, darling. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not yet; not quite yet,&rdquo; she wailed, clinging to him. &ldquo;Why, we
      have been here but a few moments. It can't be ten minutes yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under the influence of that close, passionate embrace, those clinging
      kisses and mingling tears, there began to come over Philip a feeling of
      weakness, of fainting courage, a disposition to cry out, &ldquo;Nothing can be
      so terrible as this. I will not bear it; I will not go.&rdquo; By a tyrannical
      effort of will, against which his whole nature cried out, he unwound her
      arms from his neck and said in a choked voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling, this is harder than any battle I shall have to fight, but this
      is what I enlisted for. I must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had reached the door of the summer-house, not daring for honor's sake
      to look back, when a heartbroken cry smote his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have n't kissed me good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had kissed her a hundred times, but these kisses she apparently
      distinguished from the good-by kiss. He came back, and taking her again in
      his embrace, kissed her lips, her throat, her bosom, and then once more
      their lips met, and in that kiss of parting which plucks the heart up by
      the roots.
    </p>
    <p>
      How strong must be the barrier between one soul and another that they do
      not utterly merge in moments like that, turning the agony of parting to
      the bliss of blended being!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursued by the sound of her desolate sobbing, he fled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stable-boy held the dancing horse at the gate, and Mr. Morton and his
      sister stood waiting there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Phil, till we see you again,&rdquo; said Miss Morton, kissing him
      tenderly. &ldquo;We 'll take good care of her for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please go to her now?&rdquo; he said huskily. &ldquo;She is in the
      summer-house. For God's sake try to comfort her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, poor boy, I will,&rdquo; she answered. He shook hands with Mr. Morton and
      jumped into the buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'll get a furlough and be back in a few months, maybe. Be sure to tell
      her that,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stable-boy stood aside; the mettlesome horse gave a plunge and started
      off at a three-minute gait. The boy drew out his watch and observed: &ldquo;He
      hain't got but fifteen minutes to git to camp in, but he 'll do it. The
      mare 's a stepper, and Phil King knows how to handle the ribbons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The buggy vanished in a cloud of dust around the next turn in the road.
      The stable-boy strode whistling down the street, the minister went to his
      study, and Miss Morton disappeared in the shrubbery in the direction of
      the summer-house.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Early next morning the country roads leading into Waterville were covered
      with carts and wagons and carriages loaded with people coming into town to
      see the regiment off. The streets were hung with flags and spanned with
      decorated arches bearing patriotic inscriptions. Bed, white, and blue
      streamers hung in festoons from building to building and floated from
      cornices. The stores and places of business were all closed, the sidewalks
      were packed with people in their Sunday clothes, and the windows and
      balconies were lined with gazers long before it was time for the regiment
      to appear. Everybody&mdash;men, women, and children &mdash;wore the
      national colors in cockades or rosettes, while many young girls were
      dressed throughout in red, white, and blue. The city seemed tricked out
      for some rare gala-day, but the grave faces of the expectant throng, and
      the subdued and earnest manner which extended even to the older children,
      stamped this as no ordinary holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      After hours of patient waiting, at last the word passes from mouth to
      mouth, &ldquo;They are coming!&rdquo; Vehicles are quickly driven out of the way, and
      in a general hush all eyes are turned towards the head of the street.
      Presently there is a burst of martial music, and the regiment comes
      wheeling round the corner into view and fills the wide street from curb to
      curb with its broad front. As the blue river sweeps along, the rows of
      polished bayonets, rising and falling with the swinging tread of the men,
      are like interminable ranks of foam-crested waves rolling in upon the
      shore. The imposing mass, with its rhythmic movement, gives the impression
      of a single organism. One forgets to look for the individuals in it,
      forgets that there are individuals. Even those who have brothers, sons,
      lovers there, for a moment almost forget them in the impression of a
      mighty whole. The mind is slow to realize that this great dragon, so
      terrible in its beauty, emitting light as it moves from a thousand
      burnished scales, with flaming crest proudly waving in the van, is but an
      aggregation of men singly so feeble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hearts of the lookers-on as they gaze are swelling fast. An afflatus
      of heroism given forth by this host of self-devoted men communicates
      itself to the most stolid spectators. The booming of the drum fills the
      brain, and the blood in the veins leaps to its rhythm. The unearthly
      gayety of the fife, like the sweet, shrill song of a bird soaring above
      the battle, infects the nerves till the idea of death brings a scornful
      smile to the lips. Eyes glaze with rapturous tears as they rest upon the
      flag. There is a thrill of voluptuous sweetness in the thought of dying
      for it. Life seems of value only as it gives the poorest something to
      sacrifice. It is dying that makes the glory of the world, and all other
      employments seem but idle while the regiment passes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time for farewells is gone by. The lucky men at the ends of the ranks
      have indeed an opportunity without breaking step to exchange an occasional
      hand-shake with a friend on the sidewalk, or to snatch a kiss from wife or
      sweetheart, but those in the middle of the line can only look their
      farewells. Now and then a mother intrusts her baby to a file-leader to be
      passed along from hand to hand till it reaches the father, to be sent back
      with a kiss, or, maybe, perched aloft on his shoulder, to ride to the
      depot, crowing at the music and clutching at the gleaming bayonets. At
      every such touch of nature the people cheer wildly. From every window and
      balcony the ladies shower garlands upon the troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where is Grace? for this is the Upton company which is passing now. Yonder
      she stands on a balcony, between Mr. Morton and his sister. She is very
      pale and the tears are streaming down her cheeks, but her face is radiant.
      She is smiling through her tears, as if there was no such thing on earth
      as fear or sorrow. She has looked forward to this ordeal with harrowing
      expectations, only to find herself at the trying moment seized upon and
      lifted above all sense of personal affliction by the passion of
      self-devotion with which the air is electric. Her face as she looks down
      upon her lover is that of a priestess in the ecstasy of sacrifice. He is
      saluting with his sword. Now he has passed. With a great sob she turns
      away. She does not care for the rest of the pageant. Her patriotism has
      suddenly gone. The ecstasy of sacrifice is over. She is no longer a
      priestess, but a brokenhearted girl, who only asks to be led away to some
      place where she can weep till her lover returns.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was to be a great battle the next day. The two armies had been long
      manoeuvring for position, and now they stood like wrestlers who have
      selected their holds and, with body braced against body, knee against
      knee, wait for the signal to begin the struggle. There had been during the
      afternoon some brisk fighting, but a common desire to postpone the
      decisive contest till the morrow had prevented the main forces from
      becoming involved. Philip's regiment had thus far only been engaged in a
      few trifling skirmishes, barely enough to stir the blood. This was to be
      its first battle, and the position to which it had been allotted promised
      a bloody baptism in the morning. The men were in excellent heart, but as
      night settled down, there was little or no merriment to be heard about the
      camp-fires. Most were gathered in groups, discussing in low tones the
      chances of the morrow. Some, knowing that every fibre of muscle would be
      needed for the work before them, had wisely gone to sleep, while here and
      there a man, heedless of the talk going on about him, was lying on his
      back staring up at the darkening sky, thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the twilight deepened, Philip strolled to the top of a little knoll
      just out of the camp and sat down, with a vague notion of casting up
      accounts a little in view of the final settlement which very possibly
      might come for him next day. But the inspiration of the scene around him
      soon diverted his mind from personal engrossments. Some distance down the
      lines he could see the occasional flash of a gun, where a battery was
      lazily shelling a piece of woods which it was desirable to keep the enemy
      from occupying during the night. A burning barn in that direction made a
      flare on the sky. Over behind the wooded hills where the Confederates lay,
      rockets were going up, indicating the exchange of signals and the
      perfecting of plans which might mean defeat and ruin to him and his the
      next day. Behind him, within the Federal lines, clouds of dust, dimly
      outlined against the glimmering landscape, betrayed the location of the
      roads along which artillery, cavalry, infantry were hurrying eagerly
      forward to take their assigned places for the morrow's work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who said that men fear death? Who concocted that fable for old wives? He
      should have stood that night with Philip in the midst of a host of one
      hundred and twenty-five thousand men in the full flush and vigor of life,
      calmly and deliberately making ready at dawn to receive death in its most
      horrid forms at one another's hands. It is in vain that Religion invests
      the tomb with terror, and Philosophy, shuddering, averts her face; the
      nations turn from these gloomy teachers to storm its portals in exultant
      hosts, battering them wide enough for thousands to charge through abreast.
      The heroic instinct of humanity with its high contempt of death is wiser
      and truer, never let us doubt, than superstitious terrors or philosophic
      doubts. It testifies to a conviction, deeper than reason, that man is
      greater than his seeming self; to an underlying consciousness that his
      mortal life is but an accident of his real existence, the fashion of a
      day, to be lightly worn and gayly doffed at duty's call.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a pity it truly is that the tonic air of battlefields&mdash;the air
      that Philip breathed that night before Antietam&mdash;cannot be gathered
      up and preserved as a precious elixir to reinvigorate the atmosphere in
      times of peace, when men grow faint of heart and cowardly, and quake at
      thought of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers huddled in their blankets on the ground slept far more
      soundly that night before the battle than their men-folk and women-folk in
      their warm beds at home. For them it was a night of watching, a vigil of
      prayers and tears. The telegraph in those days made of the nation an
      intensely sensitive organism, with nerves a thousand miles long. Ere its
      echoes had died away, every shot fired at the front had sent a tremor to
      the anxious hearts at home. The newspapers and bulletin boards in all the
      towns and cities of the North had announced that a great battle would
      surely take place the next day, and, as the night closed in, a mighty
      cloud of prayer rose from innumerable firesides, the self-same prayer from
      each, that he who had gone from that home might survive the battle,
      whoever else must fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wife, lest her own appeal might fail, taught her cooing baby to lisp
      the father's name, thinking that surely the Great Father's heart would not
      be able to resist a baby's prayer. The widowed mother prayed that if it
      were consistent with God's will he would spare her son. She laid her
      heart, pierced through with many sorrows, before Him. She had borne so
      much, life had been so hard, her boy was all she had to show for so much
      endured,&mdash;might not this cup pass? Pale, impassioned maids, kneeling
      by their virgin beds, wore out the night with an importunity that would
      not be put off. Sure in their great love and their little knowledge that
      no case could be like theirs, they beseeched God with bitter weeping for
      their lovers' lives, because, forsooth, they could not bear it if hurt
      came to them. The answers to many thousands of these agonizing appeals of
      maid and wife and mother were already in the enemy's cartridge-boxes.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day came. The dispatches in the morning papers stated that the armies
      would probably be engaged from an early hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who that does not remember those battle-summers can realize from any
      telling how the fathers and mothers, the wives and sisters and sweethearts
      at home, lived through the days when it was known that a great battle was
      going on at the front in which their loved ones were engaged? It was very
      quiet in the house on those days of battle. All spoke in hushed voices and
      stepped lightly. The children, too small to understand the meaning of the
      shadow on the home, felt it and took their noisy sports elsewhere. There
      was little conversation, except as to when definite news might be
      expected. The household work dragged sadly, for though the women sought
      refuge from thought in occupation, they were constantly dropping whatever
      they had in hand to rush away to their chambers to face the presentiment,
      perhaps suddenly borne in upon them with the force of a conviction, that
      they might be called on to bear the worst. The table was set for the
      regular meals, but there was little pretense of eating. The eyes of all
      had a far-off expression, and they seemed barely to see one another. There
      was an intent, listening look upon their faces, as if they were hearkening
      to the roar of the battle a thousand miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many pictures of battles have been painted, but no true one yet, for the
      pictures contain only men. The women are unaccountably left out. We ought
      to see not alone the opposing lines of battle writhing and twisting in a
      death, embrace, the batteries smoking and flaming, the hurricanes of
      cavalry, but innumerable women also, spectral forms of mothers, wives,
      sweethearts, clinging about the necks of the advancing soldiers, vainly
      trying to shield them with their bosoms, extending supplicating hands to
      the foe, raising eyes of anguish to Heaven. The soldiers, grim-faced, with
      battle-lighted eyes, do not see the ghostly forms that throng them, but
      shoot and cut and stab across and through them as if they were not there,&mdash;yes,
      through them, for few are the balls and bayonets that reach their marks
      without traversing some of these devoted breasts. Spectral, alas, is their
      guardianship, but real are their wounds and deadly as any the combatants
      receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after breakfast on the day of the battle Grace came across to the
      parsonage, her swollen eyes and pallid face telling of a sleepless night.
      She could not bear her mother's company that day, for she knew that she
      had never greatly liked Philip. Miss Morton was very tender and
      sympathetic. Grace was a little comforted by Mr. Morton's saying that
      commonly great battles did not open much before noon. It was a respite to
      be able to think that probably up to that moment at least no harm had come
      to Philip. In the early afternoon the minister drove into Waterville to
      get the earliest bulletins at the &ldquo;Banner&rdquo; office, leaving the two women
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter part of the afternoon a neighbor who had been in Waterville
      drove by the house, and Miss Morton called to him to know if there were
      any news yet. He drew a piece of paper from his pocket, on which he had
      scribbled the latest bulletin before the &ldquo;Banner&rdquo; office, and read as
      follows: &ldquo;The battle opened with a vigorous attack by our right. The enemy
      was forced back, stubbornly contesting every inch of ground. General
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s division is now bearing the brunt of the fight and
      is suffering heavily. The result is yet uncertain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The division mentioned was the one in which Philip's regiment was
      included. &ldquo;Is suffering heavily,&rdquo;&mdash;those were the words. There was
      something fearful in the way the present tense brought home to Grace a
      sense of the battle as then actually in progress. It meant that while she
      sat there on the shady piazza with the drowsy hum of the bees in her ears,
      looking out on the quiet lawn where the house cat, stretched on the grass,
      kept a sleepy eye on the birds as they flitted in the branches of the
      apple-trees, Philip might be facing a storm of lead and iron, or, maybe,
      blent in some desperate hand-to-hand struggle, was defending his life&mdash;her
      life&mdash;against murderous cut and thrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin to pray for his safety was not to dare to cease, for to cease
      would be to withdraw a sort of protection&mdash;all, alas I she could give
      &mdash;and abandon him to his enemies. If she had been watching over him
      from above the battle, an actual witness of the carnage going on that
      afternoon on the far-off field, she could scarcely have endured a more
      harrowing suspense from moment to moment. Overcome with the agony, she
      threw herself on the sofa in the sitting-room and lay quivering, with her
      face buried in the pillow, while Miss Morton sat beside her, stroking her
      hair and saying such feeble, soothing words as she might.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is always hard, and for ardent temperaments almost impossible, to hold
      the mind balanced in a state of suspense, yielding overmuch neither to
      hope nor to fear, under circumstances like these. As a relief to the
      torture which such a state of tension ends in causing, the mind at length,
      if it cannot abandon itself to hope, embraces even despair. About five
      o'clock Miss Morton was startled by an exceeding bitter cry. Grace was
      sitting upon the sofa. &ldquo;Oh, Miss Morton!&rdquo; she cried, bursting into tears
      which before she had not been able to shed, &ldquo;he is dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace! Grace! what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead, I know he is dead!&rdquo; wailed the girl; and then she explained
      that while from moment to moment she had sent up prayers for him, every
      breath a cry to God, she suddenly had been unable to pray more, and this
      she felt was a sign that petition for his life was now vain. Miss Morton
      strove to convince her that this was but an effect of overwrought nerves,
      but with slight success.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early evening Mr. Morton returned with the latest news the
      telegraph had brought. The full scope of the result was not yet known. The
      advantage had probably remained with the National forces, although the
      struggle had been one of those close and stubborn ones, with scanty
      laurels for the victors, to be expected when men of one race meet in
      battle. The losses on both sides had been enormous, and the report was
      confirmed that Philip's division had been badly cut up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parsonage was but one of thousands of homes in the land where no lamps
      were lighted that evening, the members of the household sitting together
      in the dark,&mdash;silent, or talking in low tones of the far-away
      star-lighted battlefield, the anguish of the wounded, the still heaps of
      the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, when at last Grace went home she was less entirely
      despairing than in the afternoon. Mr. Morton, in his calm, convincing way,
      had shown her the groundlessness of her impression that Philip was
      certainly dead, and had enabled her again to entertain hope. It no longer
      rose, indeed, to the height of a belief that he had escaped wholly
      scathless. In face of the terrible tidings, that would have been too
      presumptuous. But perhaps he had been only wounded. Yesterday the thought
      would have been insupportable, but now she was eager to make this
      compromise with Providence. She was distinctly affected by the curious
      superstition that if we voluntarily concede something to fate, while yet
      the facts are not known, we gain a sort of equitable assurance against a
      worse thing. It was settled, she told herself, that she was not to be
      overcome or even surprised to hear that Philip was wounded,&mdash;slightly
      wounded. She was no better than other women, that he should be wholly
      spared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper next morning gave many names of officers who had fallen, but
      Philip's was not among them. The list was confessedly incomplete;
      nevertheless, the absence of his name was reassuring. Grace went across
      the garden after breakfast to talk with Miss Morton about the news and the
      auspicious lack of news. Her friend's cheerful tone infused her with fresh
      courage. To one who has despaired, a very little hope goes to the head Eke
      wine to the brain of a faster, and, though still very tremulous, Grace
      could even smile a little now and was almost cheerful. Secretly already
      she was beginning to play false with fate, and, in flat repudiation of her
      last night's compact, to indulge the hope that her soldier had not been
      even wounded. But this was only at the bottom of her heart. She did not
      own to herself that she really did it. She felt a little safer not to
      break the bargain yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      About eleven o'clock in the forenoon Mr. Morton came in. His start and
      look of dismay on seeing Grace indicated that he had expected to find his
      sister alone. He hastily attempted to conceal an open telegram which he
      held in his hand, but it was too late. Grace had already seen it, and
      whatever the tidings it might contain, there was no longer any question of
      holding them back or extenuating them. Miss Morton, after one look at her
      brother's face, silently came to the girl's side and put her arms around
      her waist. &ldquo;Christ, our Saviour,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;for thy name's sake, help
      her now.&rdquo; Then the minister said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try to be brave, try to bear it worthily of him; for, my poor little
      girl, your sacrifice has been accepted. He fell in a charge at the head of
      his men.&rdquo;
     </p>

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </div>
    <h2>
      V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Philip's body was brought home for burial, and the funeral was a great
      event in the village. Business of all kinds was suspended, and all the
      people united in making of the day a solemn patriotic festival. Mr. Morton
      preached the funeral sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, talk about the country,&rdquo; sobbed Grace, when he asked her if there was
      anything in particular she would like him to speak of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For pity's sake don't let me feel sorry now that I gave him up for the
      Union. Don't leave me now to think it would have been better if I had not
      let him go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he preached of the country, as ministers sometimes did preach in those
      days, making it very plain that in a righteous cause men did well to die
      for their native land and their women did well to give them up. Expounding
      the lofty wisdom of self-sacrifice, he showed how truly it was said that
      &ldquo;whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his
      life... shall find it,&rdquo; and how none make such rich profit out of their
      lives as the heroes who seem to throw them away.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had come, he told the assembled people, to mourn no misadventure, no
      misfortune; this dead soldier was not pitiable. He was no victim of a
      tear-compelling fate. No broken shaft typified his career. He was rather
      one who had done well for himself, a wise young merchant of his blood, who
      having seen a way to barter his life at incredible advantage, at no less a
      rate indeed than a man's for a nation's, had not let slip so great an
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he went on, still likening the life of a man to the wares of a
      shopkeeper, worth to him only what they can be sold for and a loss if
      overkept, till those who listened began to grow ill at ease in presence of
      that flag-draped coffin, and were vaguely troubled because they still
      lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he spoke of those who had been bereaved. This soldier, he said, like
      his comrades, had staked for his country not only his own life but the
      earthly happiness of others also, having been fully empowered by them to
      do so. Some had staked with their own lives the happiness of parents, some
      that of wives and children, others maybe the hopes of maidens pledged to
      them. In offering up their lives to their country they had laid with them
      upon the altar these other lives which were bound up with theirs, and the
      same fire of sacrifice had consumed them both. A few days before, in the
      storm of battle, those who had gone forth had fulfilled their share of the
      joint sacrifice. In a thousand homes, with tears and the anguish of
      breaking hearts, those who had sent them forth were that day fulfilling
      theirs. Let them now in their extremity seek support in the same spirit of
      patriotic devotion which had upheld their heroes in the hour of death. As
      they had been lifted above fear by the thought that it was for their
      country they were dying, not less should those who mourned them find
      inspiration in remembering it was for the nation's sake that their tears
      were shed, and for the country that their hearts were broken. It had been
      appointed that half in blood of men and half in women's tears the ransom
      of the people should be paid, so that their sorrow was not in vain, but
      for the healing of the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It behooved these, therefore, to prove worthy of their high calling of
      martyrdom, and while they must needs weep, not to weep as other women
      wept, with hearts bowed down, but rather with uplifted faces, adopting and
      ratifying, though it might be with breaking hearts, this exchange they had
      made of earthly happiness for the life of their native land. So should
      they honor those they mourned, and be joined with them not only in
      sacrifice but in the spirit of sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was in response to the appeal of this stricken girl before him that
      the minister talked of the country, and to such purpose was it that the
      piteous thing she had dreaded, the feeling, now when it was forever too
      late, that it would have been better if she had kept her lover back, found
      no place in her heart. There was, indeed, had she known it, no danger at
      all that she would be left to endure that, so long as she dreaded it, for
      the only prayer that never is unanswered is the prayer to be lifted above
      self. So to pray and so to wish is but to cease to resist the divine
      gravitations ever pulling at the soul. As the minister discoursed of the
      mystic gain of self-sacrifice, the mystery of which he spoke was fulfilled
      in her heart. She appeared to stand in some place overarching life t and
      death, and there was made partaker of an exultation whereof if religion
      and philosophy might but catch and hold the secret, their ancient quest
      were over.
